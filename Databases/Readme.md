In memory buffer is a temparory storage in RAM for holding the data before transferring to one place to another.
Here are a few common uses of in-memory buffers:
I/O Operations: Data from a slower device, like a hard drive, can be loaded into an in-memory buffer before being processed by a faster device, such as the CPU. This reduces the need for the CPU to wait for data from the slower device.
Streaming: In audio or video streaming, data is buffered in memory to ensure smooth playback, compensating for network or processing delays.
Database Operations: In-memory buffers are also used in databases to cache frequently accessed data, reducing disk access and improving performance.
