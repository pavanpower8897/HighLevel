# Notification Service

Scaling notifications is a bit hard 
Ex: If a celebraty posted something we have to send notification to million of followers 
Why youtbude has bell icon ?
To understand who are loyal followers and giving priority to them (Means sending real time notifications compared to other normal followers)

Why ?


## Functional requirements 
 * Sending notification to certain user (All devices and on certain device)
 * Scheduling a notification 
 * Aggregating notification data (If same kind of notification comes then we can show +199 users comments/reacted on certain post)
 * Supporting different notificaitons (push notification, email, sms etc )


## Non Functional requirements 
 * Highly Available 
 * Highly scalable 

## Scale

## Entities
