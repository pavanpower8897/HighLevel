ðŸ§  How to Think About It as a System Designer
Donâ€™t assume:

Events will come once and on time.

Your processor will never crash.

Your data pipeline will always be consistent.

Instead, ask:

"If I get this event twice, what will happen?"

"If this event is late by 10 minutes, will it still be useful?"

"If I reprocess yesterdayâ€™s data, will I corrupt todayâ€™s?"
