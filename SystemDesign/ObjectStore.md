Objects are massive unstructed data. Its basically chunk of data like images/videos and VMs.

Famous Object stores are S3 AWS
In AWS S3 by looking at the file path of the object it looks like objects are stored in file storage but its just an illusion inside there will be a list of buckets and each bucket will be allocated to a unique identifier accross all the accounts and inside each bucket will contain a list of objects which will be associated with list of objects with unique ids.
